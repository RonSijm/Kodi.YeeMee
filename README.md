# Kodi - YeeMee plugin.

I made it work for Kodi 21.2 (Latest as of current) - I haven't tested it on other versions.

## Installation instructions

- Clone/download this repo
- Copy the folder "service.yeemee"
- (On Windows)
- Go to "%appdata%\Kodi\addons" in your file explorer
- Copy the folder there.
